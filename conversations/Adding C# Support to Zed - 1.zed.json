As of my last update in October 2023, Zed does not natively support C# out of the box. However, you can add support for C# through extensions or plugins, or by configuring the editor to use external tools and language servers.\n\nHere are some general steps you might follow to add C# support to Zed:\n\n1. **Install a C# Language Server**: Language servers provide features like auto-completion, go-to-definition, and linting. The most popular language server for C# is OmniSharp. You can install it by following the instructions on the OmniSharp GitHub page.\n\n2. **Configure Zed to Use the Language Server**: Zed needs to be configured to use the language server for C#. This typically involves editing a configuration file to point to the OmniSharp server.\n\n3. **Install Necessary Extensions**: If Zed supports extensions, you might need to install an extension that integrates with OmniSharp or provides C# support.\n\n4. **Configure Build and Debugging Tools**: To fully support C# development, you might also need to configure build and debugging tools. This could involve setting up tasks or scripts that Zed can run to build and debug your C# code.\n\nHere is a more detailed example of how you might set this up:\n\n### Step-by-Step Example\n\n1. **Install OmniSharp**:\n   - Download and install OmniSharp from the [OmniSharp GitHub repository](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).\n\n2. **Configure Zed**:\n   - Open Zed and go to the settings or configuration file.\n   - Add a configuration entry to point to the OmniSharp language server. This might look something like this (note that the exact configuration syntax will depend on Zed's configuration system):\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"languageServers\": {\n         \"csharp\": {\n           \"command\": \"path/to/omnisharp\",\n           \"args\": [\"-lsp\"]\n         }\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Install C# Extensions**:\n   - If Zed supports extensions, search for and install any extensions related to C# or OmniSharp.\n\n4. **Configure Build and Debugging**:\n   - Set up tasks or scripts in Zed to build and debug your C# projects. This might involve creating a `tasks.json` file or similar configuration.\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"tasks\": {\n         \"build\": {\n           \"command\": \"dotnet\",\n           \"args\": [\"build\"]\n         },\n         \"debug\": {\n           \"command\": \"dotnet\",\n           \"args\": [\"run\"]\n         }\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n### Note\n\nThe exact steps and configurations will depend on the specific version of Zed you are using and its capabilities. If Zed does not support language servers or extensions, you might need to use an external editor or IDE that has built-in support for C#, such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.\n\nAlways refer to the official documentation of Zed and OmniSharp for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":45}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":24},"start":34,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":46}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":2977,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":47}}}],"summary":"Adding C# Support to Zed","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
